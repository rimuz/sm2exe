# Sm2Exe, a simple Smudge wrapper for generating PE executables.

### What does that mean?

**Sm2Exe** is a program which reads from an **SMK** file and outputs the bytecode
to the PE resources of a pre-built version of the **interpreter**.

To make a long story short, Sm2Exe is able to generate a independent PE file (`.exe`) from any Smudge program.
